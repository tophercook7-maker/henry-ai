# Critical Fixes Summary for Henry AI

## Issues Found from User Testing:

### 1. **Scrolling Broken** ❌
- Only works in Chat and Setup Wizard tabs
- Welcome tab buttons cut off at bottom
- Settings, Usage, Documents, File Manager - no scrolling

**Fix:** Change `overflow-y: auto` to `overflow-y: scroll` in `.content-body`

### 2. **Henry's Self-Awareness Wrong** ❌
- Free mode says "I can guide you" but can't actually DO anything
- Doesn't know what he CAN do with API key
- Responses are inaccurate about capabilities

**Fix:** Update `generateFreeAIResponse()` to accurately describe:
- What he CAN do with API key (write code, organize files, process docs)
- That he needs API key to execute tasks, not just talk about them
- Emphasize he's designed to DO things, not just guide

### 3. **File Manager Buttons Don't Work** ❌
- Quick Action buttons (Browse Desktop, Downloads, etc.) do nothing
- Search button doesn't work
- No feedback when clicked

**Fix:** 
- Add `onclick` handlers to all buttons
- Create `browseFolder()` function
- Update `searchFiles()` to show proper messages
- Explain web vs desktop limitations

### 4. **Settings Buttons Don't Work** ❌
- Save Settings button doesn't provide feedback
- Test Connection button doesn't work properly
- Budget settings don't save

**Fix:**
- Add proper success/error messages
- Implement actual API key testing
- Save budget limits to localStorage
- Show confirmation messages

### 5. **Document Processing Fails** ❌
- Process Document button doesn't work
- No error handling
- File upload issues

**Fix:**
- Add proper error handling
- Check for API key before processing
- Show clear error messages
- Handle file reading properly

### 6. **Cost Counters Don't Show** ❌
- Real-time cost not displayed after messages
- Session stats not updating
- No visual feedback on spending

**Fix:**
- Add `showCostNotification()` after each message
- Update session stats in real-time
- Display cost in chat: "$0.0050 (~0.5¢)"

1. **Fix scrolling** - Critical UX issue
2. **Fix Henry's responses** - Core functionality
3. **Make buttons work** - User expects functionality
4. **Add proper error messages** - Better UX
5. **Show costs in real-time** - Key selling point
